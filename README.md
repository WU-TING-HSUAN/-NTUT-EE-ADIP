# NTUT EE ADIP HW
## :heart_eyes: Introduction my self
大家好，我是吳定軒，目前就讀於國立台北科技大學電機工程系碩士班，我將在我的github上分享我所實作的Project，內容也有許多需要改進的地方，如果你有甚麼建議歡迎寫信到我的信箱t109318095@ntut.org.tw。   

Hello everyone, I am TINGHSUAN-WU. I am currently studying in the Master's Program of the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taipei University of Technology. I will share the projects I have done on my Github. There are many areas for improvement in the content. If you have any suggestions, welcome Write to my mailbox.

## :yum: Introduction this project
這份作業是ADIP(高等數位影像處理)，我使用純C++ 來撰寫，但我還是有些地方使用了Opencv內建的程式碼，因為起初我不知道那是Opencv的內建程式碼，所以我會在解說時補上C++的語法。

This assignment is ADIP (Advanced Digital Image Processing). I use pure C++ to write, but I still use Opencv's built-in code in some places, because at first I didn't know that it was Opencv's built-in code, so I will add the C++ syntax in the explanation.

## :warning:嚴禁抄襲
這些只是提供我自己的想法而已，程式碼撰寫得也沒有到很嚴謹，希望不會有抄襲的狀況發生。

These are just to provide my own ideas, and the code is not written very rigorously. I hope that there will be no plagiarism.
